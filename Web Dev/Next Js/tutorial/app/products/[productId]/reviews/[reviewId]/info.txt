### error.tsx
# automatically wrap a route segment and its nested children in a React error boundary
# create error UI tailored to a specific segments using the file-system hierarchy to adjust granularity
# isolate errors to affected segments while keeping the rest of the application functional
add functionality to attempt to recover from an error without a full page reload


### handling errors in nested route segments
# errors bubble up to the closest parent error boundary
# an error.tsx file will cater to errors for all its nested child segments
# by positioning error.tsx file at different levels, a more granular level of error handling can be achieved

### handling error in layout.tsx
# if an error occurs in layout.tsx file, it will be handled by error.tsx only if this file is placed in parent directory of layout.tsx
