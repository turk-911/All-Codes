# wrapping the folder name in parenthesis means that it is route grouping, now it won't be shown in the url
firstly the url was like localhost:3000/auth/register but it might not be well suited for marketing so wrapped up in parenthesis
now the url looks like this := localhost:3000/register and everything works perfectly DAMN


if we rename the file from layout.tsx to template.tsx, the state will not be preserved across files
state will be set to default value as soon as we change the page
